# BikeSharingAssignment
Bike sharing service for customers to rent the bike temporarily.

## Objective

A bike-sharing system is a service that provides bikes for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis, either for a fee or sometimes even for free. These systems typically feature computer-controlled docks where users can input their payment information to unlock a bike. Once unlocked, the bike can be used and later returned to another dock within the same system. In this case study, our primary objective is to investigate the key factors influencing the demand for shared bikes, particularly in the American market. The company's specific inquiries include:

Identifying Significant Variables: We aim to determine which variables play a crucial role in predicting the demand for shared bikes. By analyzing the data, we can pinpoint the factors that have a meaningful impact on bike rental demand.

Understanding Demand Drivers: We will assess how well these identified variables describe the variations in bike rental demands. This analysis will provide insights into the strength and direction of the relationships between these factors and the demand for shared bikes.

The ultimate goal of this study is to provide the bike-sharing company with actionable insights into the American market, helping them adapt their strategies and operations to meet customer expectations and optimize their business for success in this unique market context.
